Captain, I'm detecting an energy signature in sector 7-G. It's... unusual.

<!-- Frame 4: Agent's first response (speak operations) -->
Interesting. That energy signature wasn't there during our initial orbital scan.

Lieutenant Rodriguez, can you get me more details on that anomaly? Run a deep scan on sector 7-G, focusing on electromagnetic and subspace frequencies.

Commander Chen, maintain our current orbit but be ready to break away if needed.

This is what we've been searching for. After nearly a year in deep space, we might have found intelligent life. Need to proceed carefully - this could be automated, ancient, or active. The crew is excited but I need to keep them focused.

Dr. Tanaka, good timing. Look at this pattern - prime numbers broadcast at regular intervals. What's your assessment?
