# Agent Integration Summary

## What We Implemented

### 1. AgentInterface
- Core interface that all agents must implement
- Methods for frame processing, activation checking, cycle running, and parsing
- Support for agent state (sleeping, ignoring sources, etc.)

### 2. BasicAgent
- Concrete implementation of AgentInterface
- Integrates with VEIL, HUD, Compression, and LLM
- Parses XML completions into VEIL operations
- Supports tool calls and stream-based routing

### 3. AgentComponent
- Bridges the agent with the Space/Element system
- Handles frame:end events and agent commands
- Can be attached to any element in the tree

### 4. Full Integration Test
- Shows Discord-like adapter generating messages
- Agent processes frames and generates responses
- Demonstrates sleeping/wake states
- Uses MockLLMProvider for deterministic testing

## Architecture Flow

```
Discord Event → Space Frame → VEIL Operations → Agent Activation
                                                        ↓
                                              Build Context (HUD)
                                                        ↓
                                                   Call LLM
                                                        ↓
                                              Parse Response
                                                        ↓
                                          Create Outgoing Frame
                                                        ↓
                                             Record in VEIL
```

## Key Features

1. **Frame-based Processing**: Agent only processes completed frames
2. **Activation Control**: Priority levels, sleeping states, source ignoring
3. **Stream Routing**: Responses automatically routed to active stream
4. **Tool Support**: Parsed from XML and executed via callbacks
5. **Clean Parsing**: Extracts thoughts, speech, and tool calls from `<my_turn>` blocks

## What's Working

✅ Agent receives and processes incoming frames
✅ Activation logic with priority and state checks
✅ LLM integration with mock provider
✅ Response parsing into VEIL operations
✅ Frame recording in VEIL state
✅ Agent state management (sleep/wake)

## What Could Be Enhanced

1. **Adapter Notification**: Currently adapters must poll VEIL state for responses
2. **Tool Result Handling**: Tool results aren't fed back to the agent
3. **Cycle Requests**: Agent can request another cycle but it's not fully implemented
4. **Real LLM Providers**: Need OpenAI/Anthropic implementations

## Next Steps

The agent system is functional and ready for:
- Real LLM provider implementations
- More sophisticated adapters (Discord, Minecraft, etc.)
- Tool implementations with result feedback
- Production deployment

The architecture successfully separates concerns:
- **VEIL** handles state and history
- **HUD** renders context with compression
- **Agent** decides when/how to respond
- **Space/Element** orchestrates everything
