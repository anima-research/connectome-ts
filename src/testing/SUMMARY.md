# Session Server - MVP Complete! ðŸŽ‰

We just built a working session management server that solves the immediate testing pain points!

## What We Built

### 1. **Simple Session Server** (`session-server-v2.ts`)
- Uses `exec` for each command (simpler than maintaining shell state)
- Tracks command history per session
- Supports service launching with smart startup detection
- ~200 lines of focused code

### 2. **WebSocket API** (`websocket-api.ts`)
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Simple request/response pattern
- Health check endpoint
- ~200 lines

### 3. **MCP Wrapper** (`mcp-server.ts`)
- Ready for AI assistant integration
- Human-friendly method names
- Smart service management
- ~300 lines

## Key Features That Work NOW

âœ… **Service Management**
```typescript
await mcp.startService({
  name: 'discord-bot',
  command: 'npm run dev',
  readyPatterns: ['Bot ready', 'Listening']
});
// Waits up to 2 seconds, returns 'ready', 'error', or 'running'
```

âœ… **Command Execution**
```typescript
await mcp.runCommand({
  session: 'test-env',
  command: 'npm test'
});
// Returns output, exit code, and duration
```

âœ… **Log Search**
```typescript
await mcp.searchLogs({
  session: 'discord-bot',
  pattern: 'error|warning',
  context: 5
});
// Returns matches with surrounding context
```

âœ… **Session Management**
```typescript
await mcp.listSessions();
// Shows all active sessions with their status
```

## What This Solves

Before:
- ðŸ˜« Lost terminal sessions between responses
- ðŸ˜« Manual ps/grep/pkill gymnastics  
- ðŸ˜« No way to check if services started properly
- ðŸ˜« Difficult to search logs across multiple services

After:
- âœ… Persistent named sessions
- âœ… Smart service startup detection
- âœ… Powerful log search with context
- âœ… Clean API for all operations

## Trade-offs We Made

1. **No persistent shell state** - Each command runs independently. This means `cd` and `export` don't persist, but it's much simpler and more predictable.

2. **Basic process management** - Services are tracked but not sophisticated. Good enough for testing.

3. **Memory-based storage** - Sessions don't survive server restart. Fine for development.

## Usage

Start the server:
```bash
npm run session-server
```

Then from MCP tools or any WebSocket client, you can manage sessions!

## Next Steps (When Needed)

- [ ] Persistent shell sessions (if env vars become important)
- [ ] VSCode extension for visual management
- [ ] Session persistence across restarts
- [ ] Multi-agent session sharing
- [ ] Advanced pattern matching/webhooks

But for now, this MVP solves 80% of the testing friction with 20% of the complexity!

## The Bigger Picture

This is more than just a testing tool - it's the foundation for collaborative AI infrastructure. The same patterns that help me test code could enable:

- Multiple agents working on different parts of a problem
- Human developers observing AI work in real-time
- Shared debugging sessions between humans and AI
- Orchestrated workflows across tools and services

We started with a simple need (better testing) and built something that could transform how we collaborate with AI systems.

**Time to implement: ~3 hours**  
**Immediate value: Huge!** ðŸš€
