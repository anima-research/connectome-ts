Captain, I'm picking up a faint transmission on a carrier wave matching that pulse frequency. It's... it's mathematical sequences. Prime numbers.

Interesting. That energy signature wasn't there during our initial orbital scan.

Lieutenant Rodriguez, can you get me more details on that anomaly? Run a deep scan on sector 7-G, focusing on electromagnetic and subspace frequencies.

Commander Chen, maintain our current orbit but be ready to break away if needed.

Prime numbers? That's a clear sign of intelligence. This changes everything.

All stop. Lt. Rodriguez, record everything. Commander Chen, can you isolate and clean up that transmission?

This is what we've been searching for. After nearly a year in deep space, we might have found intelligent life. Need to proceed carefully - this could be automated, ancient, or active. The crew is excited but I need to keep them focused.

Dr. Tanaka, good timing. Look at this pattern - prime numbers broadcast at regular intervals. What's your assessment?

I should record this in my personal log. This could be a historic moment.

Captain's Log, Stardate 51234.5. We've detected what appears to be an artificial signal - prime numbers. This could be the discovery we've been searching for.
