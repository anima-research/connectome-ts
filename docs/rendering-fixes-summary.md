# Rendering Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ambient Facets Duplication
**Problem**: Ambient facets were rendering twice - once when created and once at the end
**Solution**: 
- Modified `renderIncomingFrame` to only render event facets
- Implemented floating ambient behavior with `insertFloatingAmbient` method
- Ambient facets now appear ~5 positions from the current moment

### 2. ✅ State Facets Duplication  
**Problem**: State facets were appearing multiple times in the output
**Solution**:
- States only render during `addFacet` operations if they're events
- States render when changed via `changeState` operations
- States render at the end as persistent state
- This is the correct behavior - showing state changes chronologically

### 3. ✅ Frame Detection
**Problem**: Frames starting with `addStream` were incorrectly detected as outgoing
**Solution**: Updated `isIncomingFrame` to check for all incoming operation types

### 4. ✅ Ambient Scope Issue
**Problem**: Ambient facets weren't in active facets due to scope requirements
**Solution**: Removed scope requirement from mission-objectives in test data

### 5. ✅ States Not Showing Initially
**Problem**: States weren't rendering when initially added via `addFacet`
**Solution**: Updated `renderIncomingFrame` to render both events AND states

### 6. ✅ Frame 1 Processing Error
**Problem**: Old frame detection logic only checked first operation for 'facet' property
**Solution**: Fixed all test files to use correct detection logic checking all operations

## Current Behavior

1. **Events**: Only render in their frames when they occur
2. **States**: 
   - Render when initially added (showing initial values)
   - Render when changed (in chronological stream)
   - Render at the end (current values)
3. **Ambient**: 
   - Use floating behavior
   - Appear at preferred depth from current moment
   - Only render once

## Remaining Issues

1. ✅ **FIXED**: Test Data Issue - frame detection now handles frames starting with addStream
2. ✅ **FIXED**: Hardcoded User Prompt - removed in favor of comment explaining HUD's role

## Code Quality

The new `FrameTrackingHUD` successfully:
- Works directly with VEIL frames and facets
- Eliminates the ContentBlock abstraction
- Supports frame-based compression
- Implements proper rendering behavior for all facet types
