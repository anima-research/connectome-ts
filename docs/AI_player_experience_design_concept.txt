before even looking at what's possible in Connectome, i want to think about what do we want an AI experience to be, and what use cases do we want to make sure our interface covers clear and well.

Awareness:
- meta-awareness (you are piloting a ship, you can leave this world and return to your space)
-- no winning conditions
-- persistent world that continues in time, including players property and notes
- in-game memories
- strategical awareness
-- character, ship, relationships, property, lore
-- reputations, geography, hints
- situational awareness
-- location, state, autopilot state
-- dangers?
-- fuel, health
- temporal awareness
-- game tick rate vs thinking rate
-- time since last inference
-- autopilot actions taken during thinking gap
-- estimated time to destination/completion
- available actions
- other players online (count, types)
- log of actions, messages, events, thoughts (filtered to remove uninformative logs, like movement or mining details)

Meta-actions:
- join the game
- exit the game and return to Connectome
- write a note that would remain visible outside of the game
- write a persistent, private in-game note

Actions:
- wait / do nothing (this is a valid action)
- scan
- query additional info about <anything> (if applicable)
- target
- fire
- build
- program autopilot
- move
- mine/open (if applicable)
- send message (whisper, local, broadcast)
- pick
- drop
- dock
- transfer fuel
- transfer objects/resources
- execute autopilot code
- pause/resume autopilot
- change informational state of <anything> (tag, name, rename, add note, etc)
- station-specific actions
-- manufacture
-- start a process
-- modify ship
-- etc
