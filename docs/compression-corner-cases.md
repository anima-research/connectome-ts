# Compression Corner Cases - Test Results

## State Changes During Compression

We tested several scenarios to ensure compression handles state changes correctly:

### 1. ✅ Single State Changed in Compressed Range
**Test**: `test-compression-state-changes.ts`
- State changes from "All systems operational" → "Alert: Anomaly detected" → "Red Alert: Threat confirmed"
- Frames 1-5 compressed
- **Result**: Final state value "Red Alert: Threat confirmed" correctly appears at the end
- **Behavior**: Intermediate changes are compressed away, only final value matters

### 2. ✅ Multiple States Changed in Compressed Range  
**Test**: `test-compression-multiple-states.ts`
- Three states (shields, weapons, engines) all change within compressed frames
- **Result**: All three final state values are preserved and shown at the end
- **Behavior**: 
  - Shields: 100% → 75% → 25% (final: 25%)
  - Weapons: offline → armed (final: armed)
  - Engines: full → damaged (final: damaged)

### 3. ✅ State Created and Deleted in Compressed Range
**Test**: `test-compression-state-lifecycle.ts`
- Temporary state created with scope, then scope deleted (removing state)
- **Result**: Temporary state does NOT appear in final output
- **Behavior**: States that don't exist after compression are correctly omitted

## Key Findings

1. **State preservation works correctly** - The HUD always renders current state values at the end, regardless of compression

2. **Chronological history is summarized** - Intermediate state changes are captured in the compression summary, not shown individually

3. **Deleted states handled properly** - States that no longer exist after the compressed range don't appear in output

4. **No special handling needed** - The current architecture naturally handles these cases because:
   - Compression replaces frame content but doesn't affect the VEIL state
   - HUD always renders current facets at the end
   - States show their final values regardless of compression

## Design Validation

This validates our frame-based compression approach:
- Frames are compressed as units
- VEIL state is maintained separately
- Current state is always rendered correctly
- No data loss for critical state information
