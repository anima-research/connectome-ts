I want to consider making a lightweight experimental version of Connectome as an alternative to the current implementation. 

The key difference would be that it would not contain a loom dag at all. The space state would be instant only. VEIL would still be produced by elements in the space, and VEIL would be rendered by the HUD, compressed by the Compression Engine, etc, but the logic to produce it would be much simpler.

I am looking for a pretty much an independent implementation, I don't think we can reuse much code. I think we should try it in Typescript rather than Python.

Spaces are Elements. Elements are arranged in a tree in a root Space (think Unity).

What I want to do better is to avoid the hardcoding that was made in the current implementation: all events, both from adapters and internally generated should propagate through an event system to all elements that subscribe to them. Frame processing is marked by frame start events when an event in the space queue begins processing.

Communication routing is handled through a "stream reference" mechanism rather than hardcoded channels. When events arrive from external sources (Discord, Minecraft, etc.), they set the active stream for that interaction. The agent's speak operations then naturally flow to the active stream, though they can override with explicit targets when needed for cross-channel communication.

Compression Engine processing happens during the maintenance phase, HUD begins to render after the compression engine has finished its first pass. Compression Engine should have its own internal asynchronicity (compression happens ahead of when its needed for context building in the HUD), so the first pass likely will only enqueue tasks and block only if needed data is not yet available.

We should aim for integration with Discord adapter as the main target against against which to test, then we can add more elements, like an internal scratchpad, a social graph, a shell terminal, file terminal, etc.

Few word on VEIL:

VEIL is essentially a markup language for the perceptual context of an LLM. Only a part of it gets rendered in the request that is sent to the API provider. VEIL is produced by the Elements when they are handling space events through the event system. 

VEIL is composed of VEIL frames, each frame is a delta applied to the previous frame. Frames carry both their deltas and the SpaceEvents that triggered them, enabling proper turn attribution in multi-agent contexts. The `events` field in frames is crucial for turn attribution - it contains the SpaceEvents that triggered the frame, allowing the HUD to determine message roles (user/assistant/system). Elements process events through the four-phase RETM cycle, with all changes consolidated into a single frame.

VEIL state is composed of facets. The order of facets in the VEIL document determines temporality.

Facets are composed using aspects - interfaces that define capabilities rather than rigid types. This allows extensibility while maintaining semantic clarity:

Core Aspects:
- ContentAspect: Has renderable content (text/images)
- StateAspect: Contains mutable state
- EphemeralAspect: Exists only for current frame
- AgentGeneratedAspect: Created by an agent
- StreamAspect: Associated with a communication stream
- ScopedAspect: Bound to scopes

Common Facet Types (built from aspects):

Content Facets (have ContentAspect):
- Event: Strict temporality - occurs at one moment
- State: Mutable world/UI state visible to agents. Supports inline renderers:
  - attributeRenderers: For granular attribute display
  - transitionRenderers: For narrative state changes
- Ambient: Floating context that stays in attention zone
- Speech/Thought/Action: Agent-generated content
- Ephemeral: Temporary content that doesn't persist

Meta Facets (infrastructure, typically not rendered):
- stream-change, scope-change: System state changes
- agent-activation: Triggers agent processing
- rendered-context: HUD-generated context (ephemeral)
- action-definition: Tool definitions (not directly rendered)

The aspect system allows components to define custom facets while maintaining consistent behavior. The HUD uses aspects (particularly ContentAspect) to determine what to render.

Events, states and ambient contain content. The content can be a combination of text and images. They also include an id (normally does not get rendered to the agent), displayName (can be blank), and an arbitrary set of key-value pairs. Facets don't normally include a timestamp.

VEIL deltas are timestamped, but the time should not be used for most operations. Sequence numbers should be the primary method of determining ranges of deltas.

A facet can contain other facets. Temporality of the container indirectly overrides the temporality of contents (if the container is hidden the temporality of contents is irrelevant). If container is a state, then it will get shown if any of the states it contains changes.

Facets can be assigned scopes. If all scope is destroyed, the associated facets are no longer active (but are rendered in context history up to moment of the scope deletion if saliency constraints allow).

An incoming VEIL frame includes an "active stream" reference that specifies the active communication context with metadata. This stream reference determines where agent responses are directed by default.

VEIL deltas represent exotemporal changes to the perceptual state. There are only three fundamental delta types:

1. addFacet: Introduces a new facet to the VEIL state
2. changeFacet: Modifies an existing facet (deep merges changes, preserves functions like renderers)
3. removeFacet: Removes a facet from active state (preserves history)

All system behaviors are expressed through facets. Scopes, streams, and agents are managed through dedicated meta-facets rather than special operations. This unified model simplifies the architecture while maintaining full expressiveness.

VEIL as Single Source of Truth:
VEIL is the primary persistence mechanism for Connectome. All component state, agent memory, and system configuration lives in VEIL as facets. This principle ensures:
- Complete system state can be persisted by saving VEIL frames
- System state can be restored by replaying frames
- Time travel and debugging through frame history
- Clear audit trail of all state changes

Components requiring persistent state use InternalStateFacet (no ContentAspect, not rendered to agents). This maintains the purity of Receptors (stateless transformers) while allowing stateful behavior through VEIL. Effectors can maintain runtime state but should sync important state to VEIL for persistence.

Ephemeral facets are automatically cleaned up after all four phases complete, not actively removed during processing. This ensures they're available throughout the entire frame processing cycle.

Facets can include saliency hints to help the HUD make intelligent context management decisions:
- Temporal hints: transient (float 0.0-1.0+ for decay rate)
- Semantic hints: streams[], crossStream
- Importance hints: pinned, reference
- Graph relationships: linkedTo[], linkedFrom[]

An outgoing VEIL delta uses the same three delta types. Agent behavior is expressed through specific facet types:

1. Speech facets: Natural language dialogue from the agent (routed to the active stream by default, can override with explicit target)
2. Action facets: Structured tool invocations from act operations
3. Thought facets: Agent's internal reasoning process from think operations
4. AgentActivation facets: Requests for agent processing, can include source and target agent IDs

Important: Agent actions are declarations in outgoing frames. Their consequences (state changes, events) appear in subsequent incoming frames, maintaining clear causality and enabling the agent to observe the results of its actions.

The agent uses VEILStateManager convenience methods that internally create facets via addFacet operations:
- `speak()` method creates `speech` facets
- `act()` method creates `action` facets (or @element.action syntax)
- `think()` method creates `thought` facets
This allows HUDs to render them with appropriate semantic meaning while maintaining a unified operation model.

Multi-Agent Support:
The system supports multiple agents operating in the same space through:
- Agent registration via meta-facets (agent-add, agent-remove, agent-update)
- Agent attribution in facets (agentId and agentName fields)
- Targeted agent activation using agentActivation facets with sourceAgentId/targetAgentId
- Automatic attribution of agent-generated facets (speech, thought, action)
This enables complex multi-agent interactions with clear attribution and targeting.

Action Syntax:
Agents use @element.action syntax for invoking tools:
- Simple: @box.open
- With parameters: @box.open("gently") or @box.open(speed="slow", careful=true)
- Hierarchical paths: @chat.general.say("Hello")
- Block parameters: @email.send { to: alice@example.com, subject: Test }
Tools are registered with explicit paths (no wildcards) to avoid collisions.
The action parser handles inline named parameters with type inference (strings, numbers, booleans).
Note: Block format has limitations with nested braces and should be used for simple key-value pairs.

Space/Element System Requirements:

Elements are the basic building blocks arranged in a tree hierarchy, with Space as the root element. Elements can have Components that add behavior. Events flow through the element tree using a topic-based subscription system (e.g., "discord.message", "timer.expired"). 

Four-Phase Processing Architecture (RETM):
The RETM (Receptor/Effector/Transform/Maintainer) architecture provides a deterministic four-phase cycle for processing events:

Phase 1 - Events â†’ Facets (Receptors):
- Pure functions that transform SpaceEvents into Facets
- No side effects or external dependencies
- Multiple receptors can process the same event
- Stateless by design - any state must be read from VEIL

Phase 2 - Facets â†’ Facets (Transforms):
- Pure functions that process VEIL state to produce new facets
- Examples: HUD context generation, state transition detection
- Loops until no new facets are generated (enables cascading)
- Maximum of 100 iterations to prevent infinite loops
- Can read any facet in VEIL, including InternalStateFacets

Phase 3 - Facets â†’ Events/Actions (Effectors):
- Stateful components that observe facet changes
- Can emit new events, perform external actions
- Examples: Agent activation, console output, Discord messaging
- Should persist important state to VEIL via InternalStateFacets

Phase 4 - Maintenance â†’ Events (Maintainers):
- Perform system maintenance operations
- Examples: Element tree management, persistence, transition tracking
- Can emit new events for the next frame
- Cannot modify VEIL directly

This architecture provides clear data flow, testability through pure functions in Phases 1-2, and controlled side effects in Phases 3-4. The stateless nature of Receptors and Transforms ensures deterministic replay - given the same VEIL state and events, the system will always produce the same results.

Reference Injection:
The ConnectomeHost maintains a unified reference registry that is shared with spaces. Components can:
- Use @reference decorators to declare dependencies 
- Access references via requireReference() and getReference() helper methods
- References are properly resolved for subclasses through prototype chain walking
- AXON-loaded components receive reference injection after dynamic loading
This unified approach eliminates synchronization issues and simplifies component development.

AXON Protocol:

The AXON protocol enables Connectome to dynamically load components from external HTTP services, keeping the core framework protocol-agnostic. Key features:

1. **Dynamic Component Loading**: Components are loaded at runtime from URLs (e.g., `axon://localhost:8080/discord`)
2. **Manifest-Based**: Services provide a JSON manifest specifying the main module and metadata
3. **Hot Reloading**: Optional WebSocket connection for development-time module updates
4. **Parameter Passing**: URL parameters are passed to loaded components (e.g., `axon://game.server/spacegame?token=xyz`)
5. **Action Registration**: Loaded components can register actions that agents can invoke via `@element.action` syntax
6. **Module Versioning**: Cache-busting ensures fresh modules after changes
7. **RETM Support**: AXON modules can export Receptors, Effectors, Transforms, and Maintainers directly
8. **V2 Environment**: Extended environment provides all RETM interfaces and helpers

The AxonElement acts as a loader that:
- Fetches the manifest from the HTTP endpoint
- Downloads and evaluates the component module
- Instantiates the component and adds it to the element tree
- Handles hot reload notifications for development
- Manages cleanup on unmount

This architecture allows protocol-specific adapters (Discord, Minecraft, etc.) to be developed and served independently from the core Connectome framework, maintaining clean separation of concerns.

Event System Requirements:

First-class events include frame start, time events, element lifecycle (mount/unmount), and scheduled events. Adapter-specific events (Discord, filesystem, etc.) are defined by their respective elements. Events use structured element references instead of strings for source identification.

Agent Interface Requirements:

The Space has an optional AgentInterface that processes completed frames. The agent decides whether to activate based on activation operations and their metadata. Empty frames (no VEIL operations, no activations) are discarded to maintain efficiency. The agent interface receives callbacks after all components have processed frame events.

Reference System Architecture:

The ConnectomeHost maintains a unified reference registry that serves as the single source of truth for dependency injection. Key features:
- Host registry is shared with Spaces, eliminating duplicate registries
- References are injected into components via @reference decorators
- Components can access references via helper methods (requireReference, getReference)
- Reference metadata lookup supports inheritance chains for proper injection into subclasses
- AXON-loaded components receive reference resolution after dynamic loading
- The system ensures references are available before component lifecycle methods that need them

Element Tree Persistence:
- Element tree structure is persisted in VEIL via ElementTreeFacet
- Components are registered in ComponentRegistry
- Element creation/deletion is declarative via events
- ElementRequestReceptor processes element:create/delete events
- ElementTreeMaintainer handles actual instantiation

Stream References:

Communication contexts use structured stream references with metadata instead of string identifiers. Stream references include type information and relevant metadata (channel, user, etc.). This enables flexible routing without hardcoding channel names.

Lets start by defining VEIL and HUD, skipping for now spaces, elements, discord, and all that, building from the inside out. The compression engine should be sketched but the actual compression is too early to implement, we are mostly interested in the API between the compression engine and the HUD.

The compression engine is responsible for performing self-narrated narrative blocks and other extraction of other data. The actual mechanism of compression should be pluggable, but the external API should be well defined.

Key architectural decisions:
1. Compression works on VEIL frame ranges (e.g., "compress frames 10-50"), not individual facets. Frames are the stable unit that bridges VEIL operations and rendered output.
2. Frame-based compression solves the addressing fragility problem:
   - Facets can be deleted or modified after compression, breaking facet-based references
   - The rendered context changes between frames as state evolves
   - Frame sequence numbers are immutable and provide stable references
3. The compression engine needs access to both:
   - VEIL-level data: frame operations, facet metadata (saliency hints, types, relationships)
   - Rendered context: how those frames actually rendered (for attention-preserving compression)
4. This dual-access architecture enables different compression strategies:
   - Simple strategies can use just the rendered text
   - Saliency-aware strategies can use facet metadata
   - Sophisticated strategies can use both for attention-preserving compression

The HUD is responsible for assembling the actual final LLM context. It is called by the AgentLoop. HUDs are pluggable, multiple implementations can be supported. For example, the basic HUD that we will start with will render the hierarchy of VEIL nodes as pseudo-XML blocks and the will extract tool calls from the raw completion string. Another can theoretically use JSON and supply tool call instructions using tools LLM API.

To support frame-based compression, the HUD must maintain frame boundaries during rendering - tracking which rendered segments came from which VEIL frames. This enables the compression engine to understand the relationship between frames and their rendered representation.

The HUD does not store current state. Instead, it rebuilds state from the beginning for each render by replaying all frame operations. This ensures historical accuracy - each frame shows the state as it existed at that moment, not the final state.

Implementation Architecture:
- LLMProvider interface abstracts different LLM backends (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- Providers handle both message-based and prefill modes internally
- Includes retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Tracing system captures all internal operations for debugging
- File-based trace storage with rotation and export capabilities

Key HUD behaviors:
1. Events render only in their frames when they occur
2. States render when initially added (showing initial values) and when changed (chronologically)
3. Ambient facets use "floating" behavior - appearing at a preferred depth from current moment (e.g., 5 messages back) to stay in attention zone
4. Frames are the natural units of conversation - no artificial turn-based grouping
5. Facets with displayName use it as XML tags; those without displayName render as plain content
6. Agent operations are wrapped in `<my_turn>` tags for prefill compatibility
7. State is rebuilt incrementally by replaying operations from the beginning to ensure historical accuracy
8. HUD maintains both before and after states when rendering frames, enabling transition-aware rendering
9. State transitions can be rendered narratively using transitionRenderers instead of just showing value changes

Rendered context for xml-style hud would look kind of like:

The Compression Engine produces narrative blocks that replace frame ranges in the final LLM context. The HUD provides the Compression Engine with:
- The VEIL frames to potentially compress (with their operations)
- How those frames rendered as segments (maintaining frame boundaries)
- The current VEIL state (all active facets)

The Compression Engine returns frame-range replacements (e.g., "frames 10-50 become this narrative"). The HUD then applies these replacements when rendering, skipping the original frame effects and inserting narratives instead. This frame-based approach provides stable references even when facets are later modified or deleted.

State preservation in compression:
- When compressing frame ranges that contain state changes, the compression must preserve the net effect of all state mutations
- The compressed frame should include a state delta showing the union of all changes from the beginning to end of the range
- For example, if a facet's attributes change multiple times within the range, only the final values need to be preserved
- This ensures the HUD can correctly track state evolution even when frames are compressed

State transition rendering:
- State facets include inline renderers as part of their definition
- attributeRenderers: Display functions for individual attributes (e.g., "(3 items)")
- transitionRenderers: Narrative functions for state changes (e.g., "Box #3 materializes!")
- Renderers are preserved through facet operations (changeFacet maintains functions)
- StateTransitionTransform (Phase 2) automatically generates event facets from state changes
- This ensures historical consistency - old frames render with their original logic
- Renderers can be provided as functions (converted to strings for persistence) or strings

Attention-aware compression:
- Content to be compressed is wrapped in `<content_to_compress>` tags in the rendered context
- Compression instructions can be inserted at the right position (before the frames being compressed)
- This ensures the model sees content in context before compressing it, preserving attention hooks

HUD is built with awareness of a particular implementation of a Compression Engine, but a Compression Engine can be used with different HUDs.

HUD can also use different implementations of Compression Engines, provided that they keep to a common API.

Some tools can create internally scheduled events in the AgentLoop. For example, an agent can set a timer to wake up in a given interval. Similarly, an agent can choose to sleep and to postpone handling of events for a given amount of time.

Most external events are batchable, although not all. In this case they cause updates of Elements, but the AgentLoop does not call the LLM until the end of a batch.

As the first step, lets mockup a larger example of rendered context, one that contains multiple turns and shows examples of various VEIL features. We can use prefill format. For simplicity, lets assume that our mockup does not include images. The prefill format (with no images) works as follows: all content is sent as a sequence of user and assistant messages. The HUD renders frames as they naturally occur, with the last assistant message having the `<my_turn>` prefix for prefill. System prompts are handled by the agent, not the HUD.

Note, that the rendered context is not VEIL. In the rendered context it is impossible to tell the type of facets that led to its production, so it makes sense to specify that information in comments.
