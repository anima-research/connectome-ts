# Compression Implementation Summary

## What We Built

### 1. LLM Interface (`src/llm/llm-interface.ts`)
- Abstract `LLMProvider` interface for swappable implementations
- `LLMProviderFactory` for registering and creating providers
- Clean separation of LLM concerns from compression logic

### 2. Mock LLM Provider (`src/llm/mock-llm-provider.ts`)
- Deterministic testing without real LLM calls
- Smart compression for numbered events (e.g., "Events 1-10")
- Configurable responses for different test scenarios

### 3. Attention-Aware Compression Engine (`src/compression/attention-aware-engine.ts`)
- Implements the clean `CompressionEngine` interface
- Identifies compressible frame ranges based on token thresholds
- Wraps content in `<content_to_compress>` tags for proper attention
- Returns appropriate replacements:
  - Full summary for first frame in range
  - Empty string for subsequent frames in range
  - `null` for non-compressed frames

### 4. Frame-Based Compression
- Works on VEIL frame ranges, not individual facets
- Solves addressing fragility problem
- Maintains stable references across compression

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Compression Instruction Placement
The compression instruction needs to be inserted at the right spot - before the frames being compressed. This ensures the model sees the content in context before compressing it (attention-aware compression).

### 2. Abstract LLM Interface
By abstracting the LLM interface, we can:
- Test with deterministic mock responses
- Swap between different LLM providers
- Test complex compression scenarios without API costs

### 3. Frame Range Replacement
- Only the first frame in a compressed range gets the summary
- Subsequent frames return empty strings
- HUD correctly skips empty replacements (after our fix)

## Test Results

### Numbered Events Test
- Generated 50 event frames
- Compressed into 5 ranges (10 events each)
- **89% token reduction** (1165 â†’ 131 tokens)
- Clean, readable compression markers

### Example Output
```
[Compressed: Events 1-10 (10 total events)]
[Compressed: Events 11-20 (10 total events)]
[Compressed: Events 21-30 (10 total events)]
[Compressed: Events 31-40 (10 total events)]
[Compressed: Events 41-50 (10 total events)]
```

## Integration Points

The compression engine integrates cleanly with:
1. **FrameTrackingHUD**: Checks `shouldReplaceFrame()` and uses `getReplacement()`
2. **VEIL State**: Works with frames and facets directly
3. **LLM Provider**: Uses abstract interface for actual compression

## Next Steps

1. Implement real LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Add compression strategies (narrative, technical, dialogue-focused)
3. Implement async compression with progress tracking
4. Add compression quality metrics
5. Handle edge cases (very long frames, mixed content types)
